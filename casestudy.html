        <h3 class="section-header">1. Overview</h3>
        <p class="section-text">myFlix-Angular-client is a client-side web app, making use of MERN stack. It was
            originally
            built with React JS – this one, however, was built with Angular (Material). Users are able to
            create an account, update their personal data, and create a list of favorite movies, among other things.</p>

    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h3 class="section-header">2. Context & purpose</h3>
        <p class="section-text">The app was a project I built as part of CareerFoundry's bootcamp program in web
            development, being part of the Full-Stack Immersion to demonstrate practice of JavaScript
            libraries and frameworks, such as React and Angular.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h3 class="section-header">3. Objective</h3>
        <p class="section-text">The aim was to take the next step in frontend technologies add this Angular project to
            my professional portfolio on GitHub.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h3 class="section-header">4. Method</h3>
        <p class="section-text">Before getting hands-on on the client side with Angular, I created a REST-API applying
            Node.js and Express that are connected with MongoDB to form a databse. The API are accessed
            via commonly-used HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, CREATE). In order to retrieve from
            and store data, on the other hand, CRUD methods (CREATE, READ, UPDATE, DELETE) are
            applied. The API provides data (objects) about movies in JSON format.<br><br>
            In order to ensure the functionality of the API, Postman was used to conduct tests for API endpoints.
            Moreover, I included additional code for user authentication (HTTP and JWT token) and
            authorization being essential measures for user privacy and security .</p>

    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h3 class="section-header">5. Angular</h3>
        <p class="section-text">After finishing the backend, I started building the frontend users would need to
            interact with
            the server. MyFlix-Angular-client, a single-page app and responsive app, developed with
            Angular Material. It has several interface views; The main view displays a list of all movies,
            the single movie-view, shows information about the movie and allows users to add other movies to
            the user's favorite movies' list by clicking on the heart-icon. Besides from the registration and
            2 login-view, the user-profile-view allows users to update their user data and delete their
            profile.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h3 class="section-header">6. Challenges</h3>
        <p class="section-text">Angular Material in the client-side enabled me to get the best UI-look compared to the
            web
            app's React version. I really have learnt a lot of modern technologies and tools in web
            development so far. Also, I not only quickly became familiar with terminal – an indispensable must – but
            I also got aware of
            its practical use in web development. Understanding the basics of Angular, however, took me considerably
            more time
            compared to React, for instance, because it has a different syntax and (many more) rules and modules then
            React.
            <br><br>So, using
            Angular
            Material helped me to better understand a new framework but it takes definitely more time to be fluent
            therein.
            Being supported by both my mentor and coach was an important part to go through that
            project.

    <section class="section">
        <h3 class="section-header">7. Duration</h3>
        <p class="section-text">The development took a little longer than doing it with React. On the other hand,
            Angular
            Material has already included features, like built-in tests and dependencies, which make the
            development process quicker.</p>
